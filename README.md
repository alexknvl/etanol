# Etanol - a purity and nullability analysis tool for [Eta](https://github.com/typelead/eta)

Currently the project is in its initial stages, and almost nothing is implemented. The specification/algorithm/implementation details are being written - please check out the Wiki.

Thanks to [Nikita Tchayka](https://github.com/NickSeagull) for the cool name and to [Lorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde) for [Melodrama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama_(Lorde_album))!
